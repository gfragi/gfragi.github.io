Hello, I'm George M. Fragiadakis, an enthusiastic and dedicated individual with a diverse background in the academic and professional realms. Currently, I am a PhD candidate in Technoecomics of IoT and also serve as a Senior DevOps Engineer at <a href="https://studyingreece.edu.gr/study-in-greece/">Study in Greece</a>. I hold a Bachelor's degree in <a href="https://en.phys.uoa.gr/">Physics from the National Kapodistrian University in Athens</a> and pursued a Master's degree in <a href="https://www.dit.hua.gr/index.php/en/" >Informatics and Telematics from Harokopio University</a>, where I specialized in Development and Operations of Next Generation Networks and Services.

With over 8 years of experience in the technology field, I thrive on troubleshooting and implementing cutting-edge technologies. In the realm of DevOps, I possess skills in Kubernetes and Docker, enabling me to effectively orchestrate and manage containerized applications. Additionally, I have experience in implementing Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) processes, fostering efficient and streamlined development practices. My DevOps skills also encompass utilizing monitoring tools such as Grafana, ELK, Prometheus, allowing me to effectively monitor systems and maintain their stability. I am passionate about automation testing and have utilized Cypress, ensuring efficient and reliable testing processes. In addition, my academic background in technoeconomics, data engineering, and business analysis has given me a strong analytical mindset and the ability to extract insights from complex information. Additionally, my teaching experience at various education levels has honed my ability to effectively communicate complex concepts. 

Beyond my professional pursuits, my true passion lies in my family and children. They are a constant source of inspiration and motivation. These personal interests contribute to my well-rounded perspective and infuse a creative touch into my work.

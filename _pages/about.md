Hello, I'm George M. Fragiadakis, an enthusiastic and dedicated individual with a diverse background in the academic and professional realms. Currently, I am a PhD candidate in Technoecomics of IoT and also serve as a Senior DevOps Engineer at <a href="https://studyingreece.edu.gr/study-in-greece/">Study in Greece</a>. I hold a Bachelor's degree in <a href="https://en.phys.uoa.gr/">Physics from the National Kapodistrian University in Athens</a> and pursued a Master's degree in <a href="https://www.dit.hua.gr/index.php/en/" >Informatics and Telematics from Harokopio University</a>, where I specialized in Informatics & Telematics. As an Erasmus student, I had the privilege of studying at the Niehls Bohr Institute in Copenhagen. With over 8 years of experience in the technology field,  I possess a strong affinity for monitoring and utilizing tools such as Grafana, ELK, Prometheus, and Icinga2 to ensure system performance and reliability. My expertise spans across DevOps, IT and Cloud technologies, Kubernetes, Python, technoeconomics, data engineering, and business analysis. Additionally, I have hands-on experience with automation testing using Cypress, enabling efficient and robust testing processes. I find great satisfaction in leveraging automation to streamline workflows and enhance overall productivity. Additionally, my teaching experience at various education levels has honed my ability to effectively communicate complex concepts. I find immense joy in uncovering the stories hidden within data and leveraging visualization techniques to bring them to life. My true interest, aside from my professional pursuits, is my family and my children. They are an endless source of motivation and inspiration. I am eager to apply my skills and expertise to make a meaningful impact in the field I work for, driving innovation, and telling compelling stories through data visualization.

Hello, I'm George M. Fragiadakis, with a deep-rooted passion and commitment to advancing knowledge in various academic and professional fields. I recently defended my PhD, exploring the techno-economics of Cloud Services, and I am thrilled to embark on a new journey as a Postdoctoral Researcher at Harokopio University. My current research focuses on "Optimizing Human-AI Synergy: Developing a Comprehensive Benchmarking Suite for Human-AI Collaboration in Diverse Industries," where I aim to bridge the gap between human capabilities and artificial intelligence to enhance collaborative efforts across sectors.

My academic background is diverse and thorough, starting with a Bachelor's degree in <a href="https://en.phys.uoa.gr/">Physics from the National Kapodistrian University in Athens</a>. I furthered my education with a Master's degree in <a href="https://www.dit.hua.gr/index.php/en/" >Informatics and Telematics from Harokopio University</a>, specializing in the Development and Operations of Next Generation Networks and Services. The Erasmus program provided me with the invaluable opportunity to study at the Niels Bohr Institute in Copenhagen, enriching my academic experience.

Professionally, I bring over eight years of experience in the technology sector, most recently serving as a DevOps Engineer at <a href="https://studyingreece.edu.gr/study-in-greece/">Study in Greece</a>. My expertise in Kubernetes and Docker has been instrumental in managing and deploying containerized applications efficiently. My educational and professional journey has honed my analytical skills, enabling me to extract meaningful insights from complex data sets and contribute significantly to technoeconomics, data engineering, and business analysis.

Teaching has always been a passion, allowing me to share knowledge and complex concepts across various educational levels effectively. Beyond my academic and professional life, my family remains my greatest inspiration and motivation, providing a well-rounded perspective and infusing creativity into my work.

I have obtained a Bachelor's degree in <a href="https://en.phys.uoa.gr/">Physics from the National Kapodistrian University in Athens</a>.

As a participant in the Erasmus program, I had the opportunity to engage in academic pursuits at the esteemed Niels Bohr Institute located in Copenhagen.

I am currently employed as a DevOps Engineer at <a href="https://studyingreece.edu.gr/study-in-greece/">Study in Greece</a>. Having accumulated more than 8 years of experience in the technology industry, I possess a strong inclination towards resolving technical issues and implementing state-of-the-art technologies. Within the domain of DevOps, I possess proficiencies in Kubernetes and Docker, which equip me with the ability to proficiently coordinate and administer containerized applications.

Furthermore, my educational foundation in technoeconomics, data engineering, and business analysis has cultivated a robust analytical mentality and the aptitude to derive valuable insights from intricate data. Furthermore, my prior expertise in teaching across several educational levels has enhanced my proficiency in successfully conveying intricate ideas.

Beyond my professional pursuits, my true passion lies in my family and children. They are a constant source of inspiration and motivation. They contribute to my well-rounded perspective and infuse a creative touch into my work.
